# 🏠 Smart Home Real-Time Monitoring System

This project simulates a real-time IoT pipeline for smart home devices using **Apache Kafka** and integrates a machine learning model to detect anomalies or forecast energy usage. It demonstrates how to stream data, perform ML inference, and trigger alerts or forecasts in real time.

---

## 📌 Features

- 📡 Simulates IoT devices like thermostats, motion sensors, and door locks
- 🧠 Integrates a pluggable ML model for anomaly detection or forecasting
- ⚠️ Publishes alerts and predictions to Kafka topics for downstream consumers
- 🔄 Kafka producer and consumer implemented in Python
- 🌐 RESTful interface to serve ML models (e.g., Flask or TensorFlow Serving)
